# Netco Project

Welcome to the Netco Project repository! This repository contains resources and information related to the Network of Cities for Collaborative Housing (Netco) initiative. Netco Project aims to promote peer learning and exchange among city practitioners, civil society, and organizations on collective housing formulas at the local level.

## Description

Netco Project focuses on collaborative housing as a long-term policy solution to address racial, gender, and generational disparities. We believe that by fostering participation in neighbor and community engagement initiatives, we can improve access to housing and promote social cohesion in cities. Collaborative housing refers to initiatives where residents play an active role in the ongoing management of the residential community. Through this repository, we aim to share knowledge, best practices, and resources related to collaborative housing.

## Key Features
